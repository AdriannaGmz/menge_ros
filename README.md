# menge_ros
Crowd simulation tool for robot navigation based on Menge(http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/Menge/) and ROS.
It extends Menge to introduce a robot agent into the crowd and which can be controller by external ROS compatible controllers. In other worlds now menge becomes a combined simulator for both crowd and robots.
